User Story

- User logs in.

- They can then search for shows or look at their list of favorites. You can press the add to favorites button next to each show it to the favrite's list. This is what gets added to the database. Each user should have their own favorites list. 

- When you click on show more info button next to each show, you are taken to another page (show-single) that will display extra information. I need to add a 'add to favorite' button on this page.

Things I Need to work on:

- I'm getting an error (TypeError: Cannot read property 'then' of undefined) now when adding a favorites and redirecting to the next page. The show gets addded to the database but the user doesn't get redirected.

- Separating favorites list between users.


- CSS stuff
