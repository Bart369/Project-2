User Story

- User logs in.

- They can then search for shows or look at their list of favorites.

- When you click on a show you are taken to another page that will display extra
information. 

Things I Need to work on:

- I'm getting an error (TypeError: Cannot read property 'then' of undefined) now when adding a favorites and redirecting to the next page. The show gets addded to the database but the user doesn't get redirected.

- Separating favorites list between users.
